Unfortunately, Profound has ceased raiding.

We've achieved so much more than we thought we ever could since we started back in [December 2010][first-post]. Our goals have always been challenging, but attainable. We wanted to achieve realm firsts, which we did. We wanted to build a community, which we definitely did. We wanted to become an important member of the realm's community - on each realm we were on, we like to think we did this too.

However, as with all good things, this had to come to an end. Our lives changed faster than we could make raiding fit into them. This caused problems for *everybody* in the guild, and from multiple angles at once. Our final raid was on [30th April 2014][final-raid] progressing on Garrosh Heroic, and was key to the guild's final demise. With late cancellations of key members, there was ambiguity for which strategy was best to proceed with. Ultimately, it was a pointless raid, and this rung home the sound of grief and despair.

However, this isn't the end. I fully expect we will be back, in some form or another, and we'll be looking for people *just like you* to come help us in our quests and adventures.

Ishnu-dal-dieb. Zil'nok. Farewell.
