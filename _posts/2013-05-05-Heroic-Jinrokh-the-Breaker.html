<p>We thought we would have a crack at Jin&#8217;rokh Heroic last night; after figuring some stuff out we managed to pull it together for the kill.</p>
<div id="attachment_581" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  size-medium wp-image-581"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WoWScrnShot_050413_221535.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-581" alt="Breaker Broken" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WoWScrnShot_050413_221535-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Breaker Broken</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure what&#8217;s next on the list yet. Tortos appears to be a joke, and Ji-kun looks like easy money too. But for the moment we&#8217;re happy we have this first one down to help pave the way for the others!</p>
