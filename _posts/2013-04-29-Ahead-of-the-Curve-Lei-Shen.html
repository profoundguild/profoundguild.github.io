<p>We defeated Lei Shen on Sunday with a chunk of help from alts and ex. raiders in <a href="http://dubious.enjin.com/">Dubious</a> who filled our free spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/jaedenar/Martialart/achievement#81:a8249"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-577" alt="Achievement" src="{{ "/uploads/2013/04/AheadOfTheCurveLeiShen.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="450" height="105" /></a></p>
<p>With this kill we gained rank 10 on Jaedenar, and opening up heroic modes for when we have the time to invest in them. We&#8217;re still filling our raid team up, so we&#8217;re not quite ready for our regular schedule of Wednesdays and Sundays, but when we are I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see a few posts here and there with our success stories and other things.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Dubious for the help and support they&#8217;ve given us!</p>
