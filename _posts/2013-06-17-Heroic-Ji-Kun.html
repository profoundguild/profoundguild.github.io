<p>So, after many weeks of attendance issues, everyone decided to show up for the raid, and we subsequently killed Ji-Kun heroic.</p>
<div id="attachment_581" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  size-medium wp-image-581"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WoWScrnShot_061613_195954.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-581" alt="Anyone for some hot wings?" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WoWScrnShot_061613_195954.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anyone for some hot wings?</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>Fairly simple and straightforward. Too bad it took us so long.</p>
<p>Next up, Tortos and Iron Qon heroic. Onwards to victory! Or something&#8230;</p>
