<p>Now, World of Warcraft isn&#8217;t well known for its miracles. There have been none that I&#8217;ve seen in 7 years, until last night where I can only say is the first time I have seen something happen that really shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>We were on 15%, and people started dying, but we pressed on to try and push the kill. Slowly, each one of us dropped dead from [insert excuse why you would still be standing in fire]. The third phase is pretty damn easy &#8211; avoid smash, waves, engulfing flames and meteors. So long as you are not blind, you can generally avoid everything. Alas, we were dropping dead like flies locked in a greenhouse on a very hot day.</p>
<p>Last thing I remember doing was watching the raid frames and Ragnaros&#8217; health frame, seeing only DPS remained alive with the boss on 13.5%.</p>
<p>We knew Ragnaros needed to be at 10% for the kill, so it was 3.5% to go. Then I saw 12%; then quickly 11.5%, with only Leatunell alive, still dodging the fire like the boss he claims he is. Within a quick heartbeat, Leatunell fell at 10.5%. It was a wipe; suddenly:</p>

<p>Nerdgasms on Mumble, screams of joy and disbelief. What was this? The only explanation we can find is that the travel time on Leatunell&#8217;s shots kept Ragnaros in combat after we had wiped, and it just so happened that we only needed 10.5% for the kill, with these final shots netting it.</p>
<p>Is it a miracle? No. It fucking isn&#8217;t, because miracles don&#8217;t exist. It was, however, damn lucky, and I still think it wasn&#8217;t deserved. But screw it; loot!</p>
