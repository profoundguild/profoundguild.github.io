<p>We took down Shannox on heroic last night. Pretty easy, after we realised an important strategy to do with Shannox and Riplimb. He&#8217;s down anyway, with around 13 real tries, and 1 for the kill.</p>

<p>I mocked up one of those promo pictures some guilds like to make. It&#8217;s based on our first kill pose shot, so there&#8217;s different people here for it. What do you think?</p>
