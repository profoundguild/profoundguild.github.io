<p>We have merged with <strong><a title="Luminosity's Forum" href="http://luminosity.freeforums.org" target="_blank">Luminosity</a></strong> to become one of Stormscale&#8217;s very few 25 player raiding guilds, and we are looking for more members to expand our roster in preparation for the upcoming expansion release, Mists of Pandaria.</p>
<p>Currently, <strong>we are looking for any and all new applications</strong> to build and improve upon our current team, so please go ahead and fill in an application form!</p>
