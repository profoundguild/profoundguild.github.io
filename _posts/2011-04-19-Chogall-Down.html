<p>We&#8217;ve been banging our head against the wall on this guy for two weeks. Multiple 6% wipes and lots of stress with disconnects and AFKs had us at his mercy, and almost had me begging the boss for a swift death.</p>
<p>But, at last, tonight we managed to kill him. We took 2 people outside the guild, which feels like we didn&#8217;t deserve it much, but we got the achievement so who&#8217;s counting?</p>

<p>We took a screenshot pose of the boss too, but he started fading just as we&#8217;d lined up for it. Here&#8217;s two screenshots, with and without him.</p>

<p>Well done everybody! After spending what seems to be like an eternity on him, we can now start heroic modes, yay!</p>
