<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again. The sun is out, the holidays are here, and the Winter burn-out has hit us hard.</p>
<p>All the usual Spring issues are upon us, but we are not yet done with this tier of raid content. With only <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41376">Nefarian</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46753">Al&#8217;Akir</a> left to pummel, we are at an ideal position where any new recruits will get to experience first-time kills of end-raid bosses, learning the encounter from start to finish, and reap the glory of being one of the two arguably most difficult roles while doing so.</p>
<p>We are looking for both <strong>tanks (Warrior, DK or Bear)</strong> and <strong>healers (Shaman or Paladin)</strong> and encourage all active, punctual, fun and sometimes <em>damn crazy</em> people to <a href="{{ "/apply" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">apply now</a>!</p>
<p>Applications over the weekend will be fast-tracked for invites before Monday&#8217;s raid. If you are accepted as a raider, <strong>you will be raiding</strong> (we do not recruit for &#8220;bench&#8221;, only priority or casual raid roles).</p>
<p>Raid times are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday</strong>: 20:00 to 23:00 server time</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong>: 20:00 to 23:00 server time</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong>: 20:00 to 23:00 server time</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>
