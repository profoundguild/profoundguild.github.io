<p>Ever since the Cataclysm rush was over, we have been steadily gearing up with heroics, craftables and general playing experience to get use to our new-found power and glory, and applying it to our play style.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put in the hours and gained <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=4943" target="_blank">[Guild Level 5]</a>, and finally enjoying the benefits of <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/guild/twilights-hammer/profound/perk#p4" target="_blank">[Cash Flow (Rank 1)] </a>along with our previous reward <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=62799" target="_blank">[Recipe: Broiled Dragon Feast]</a> for the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5467" target="_blank">[Set the Oven to "Cataclysmic"]</a> achievement (yes, I really did make 4,300 <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=88045" target="_blank">[Starfire Espresso]</a> before the hotfix!)</p>
<p>With many of our members having <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/guild/twilights-hammer/profound/roster" target="_blank">such great gear now</a>, and getting the <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/guild/twilights-hammer/profound/achievement#15080:a4860" target="_blank">majority of our professions to 525</a>, we are pretty much ready for raiding.</p>
<p>Oh, and on a related note, recruitment is opening for our 25-player raids. Watch this space!</p>
