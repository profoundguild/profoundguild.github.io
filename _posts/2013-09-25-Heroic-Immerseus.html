<p>We managed to kill Immerseus on heroic tonight with a little trial and error. We ended up being too good and messing our cooldowns up, meaning we all wiped at the end. However, due to the stupidity of this boss, we actually got the kill on that attempt because the fight ends after the intermission. Quite dumb.</p>
