<p>We had a windfall of success on Wednesday where we stepped into Heart of Fear and found things were simply <em>working as intended</em> from the start. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62980">Imperial Vizier Zor&#8217;lok</a> is one of those bosses where you really want to know why people are dying but you&#8217;re so spread out or dealing with your own crap to help them. Attenuation has always been a fun mechanic, but put the thought of doing anything but surviving to the back of your mind and you can breeze through it so easily &#8211; I think this is where we finally got it right (except the huge boom of deaths right at the end).</p>

<p>After a tense <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62543">Blade Lord Ta&#8217;yak</a> kill (heightened by nerves from Zor&#8217;lok) we scooted over to Garalon and managed to take it down in the third pull of the night. Normally I would say that&#8217;s impressive, but he&#8217;s so easy it feels shameful to do it more than the first pull &#8211; perfectionists are never happy.</p>

<p>Overall a good day of raiding, and there&#8217;s still 2 raid days left in the week for us to make some headway on more bosses!</p>
