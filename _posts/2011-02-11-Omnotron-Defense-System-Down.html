<p>After only half of one raid night, and half of another, we managed to take down the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=42180" target="_blank">Omnotron Defense System</a> with a great deal of ease.</p>
<div id="attachment_77" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  size-medium wp-image-77"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_205827.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-77" title="Omnotron Kill Shot" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_205827-300x168.jpg" alt="Omnotron Kill Shot" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Offline</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>After defeating this encounter, it&#8217;s a wonder why it was difficult in the first place. So many times we got to below 30% and something silly happened which was completely avoidable.</p>
<p>We took some time to get a customary pose-shot too:</p>
<div id="attachment_79" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  size-medium wp-image-79"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_210055.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-79" title="Omnotron Pose Shot" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_210055-300x168.jpg" alt="Omnotron Pose Shot" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">None-otron-anymore</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve still not decided what to go for next, but we took <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41570" target="_blank">Magmaw</a> down again for loot (and he is so much harder than Omnotron!)</p>
<p>We even took a pose shot too:</p>
<div id="attachment_80" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  size-medium wp-image-80"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_225409.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-80" title="Magmaw Pose Shot" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WoWScrnShot_021011_225409-300x168.jpg" alt="Magmaw Pose Shot" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Squirmy</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>As always, well done to everyone who took part. Cheers!</p>
