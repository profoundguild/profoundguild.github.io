<p>We took down Baleroc last night, after our tremendous 15 wipes on Thursday proving we needed to go away and think about this. But after a few spreadsheets, we had a plan and we gunned for it (with a different group, too!)</p>
<p>A few wipes and minor changes later, and we got him down on the smoothest kill I&#8217;ve ever witnessed. But damn, that <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=99353">Decimating Strike</a> scares the shit out of me!</p>

<p>As you can see, it took all my cooldowns. I&#8217;m sure this was the same on other player&#8217;s action bars too.</p>
<p>Congrats to everyone! Now, back to Rhyolith&#8230; <img src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
