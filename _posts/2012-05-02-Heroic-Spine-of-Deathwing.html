<p>It&#8217;s always disheartening hitting a wall like this for a progression raiding guild. In fact, I would hazard a guess to say that half of the weeks since the Blackhorn kill, we&#8217;ve actually just been victim to real life issues. It has been hard to get the group set up, but tonight we had it perfect.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t even change tactics, and there&#8217;s the kill. That 5% nerf probably wasn&#8217;t needed &#8211; actually, I&#8217;m just gonna go out and say it: we didn&#8217;t need the nerf. It&#8217;s a shame, but say what you will.</p>
