<p>Not much to comment on here, really; we took a break from Majordomo tries to see if we could get Alysrazor down. The video guides made it look easy&#8230; and it was. Pulled around 15 attempts, downed with time to spare. Good job everyone! But next time, U NO STAND IN FIRE!</p>

<p>Overall, I loved this fight. My DPS as a tank was awesome <img src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
