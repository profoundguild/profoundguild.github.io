<p>It&#8217;s just like everybody says.</p>
<p>You get through Spine, and think to yourself &#8220;nothing can be more difficult than that, surely?&#8221; and you&#8217;d be right. We spent about a third of the time on Madness compared to Spine, and now it all seemed so easy.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this encounter is the lack of working immunity abilities for Impale. Are we always going to be limited to using a DK? I&#8217;d like my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=31850">Ardent Defender</a> to do what it says in the tooltip, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47788">Guardian Spirit</a> was pretty annoying too. But after all the planning, the hours of wipes, and the log browsing, we finally settled on a group and went ahead.</p>

<p>A very well-deserved kill from the entire guild &#8211; we would not be here without all members past and present! This is for you; all of you.</p>
