<p>It&#8217;s been a pain in the ass trying to kill this damn boss.</p>
<p>Every time we got him to 20%, every subsequent attempt would go wrong and we would have to go back to the drawing board and work out what to do differently.</p>
<p>After trying a few new tactics, we changed back and swapped in a fourth ranged DPS and voilla! The kill was in the bag!</p>

<p>We forgot to take a pose shot, so this is the best we have. Still, it&#8217;s a kill, and a well-deserved one at that. Congrats Profoundites!</p>
