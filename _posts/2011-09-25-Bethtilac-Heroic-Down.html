<p>We&#8217;ve had some trouble with Majordomo and Rhyolith recently, for various different reasons, so we decided to try for a more technical fight to take a break from the brute force of damage and healing on the other heroic modes.</p>
<p>After attempting the boss around 21 times, we finally got the kill 4 hours into the raid, at overtime, and what a deserving kill this was.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to just click into place at the start of the fight, with no fatal mistakes and some quick footing on the Broodling poppers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to mention especially that Leatunell and Iiowa, assisted by the famous XÃ¤vier, were the champions of the evening dealing with the most difficult parts of the fight. Overall, everybody played well, but I felt the execution of their tasks for those three was more notable. Well done!</p>

<p>There should be a video coming up for this kill, with full/cut Mumble audio somewhere. Look out for it soon <img src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
