<p>We&#8217;ve been running heroics on a daily basis ever since the first weekend after the release of Cataclysm, and up until now we had usually just queued for a random dungeon for the bonus Valor Points.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until last night when we decided to queue specifically for Grim Batol and finish off our guild achievement <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5143" target="_blank">[Cataclysm Dungeon Hero]</a>.</p>
{% include frameimage.html index=29 caption="Madness is all that will find you!" alt="He Dead" width="300" height="168" url="/uploads/2010/12/WoWScrnShot_122810_223824.jpg" previewurl="/uploads/2010/12/WoWScrnShot_122810_223824-300x168.jpg" %}
<p>With that complete, I guess all we can do now is look forward to our raid progression.</p>
<p>Get ready guys!</p>
