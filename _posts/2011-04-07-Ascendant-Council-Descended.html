<p>Since this was quite a technical fight for everyone involved, we weren&#8217;t sure we would be able to get it down in the one night. But, we spent only 2 hours and wiped 9 times, two of which were on 400k and 20k (less than 1%).</p>
<p>This was another exhilarating kill, and had me shaking for a few moments afterwards. I was so busy kiting the boss, I didn&#8217;t even see him go down at first!</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the Elementium Monstrosity despawned shortly after we looted it, so we didn&#8217;t quite get everyone in the screenshot.</p>

<p>Only three end-raid bosses to left kill!</p>
