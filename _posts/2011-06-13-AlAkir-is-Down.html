<p>We&#8217;ve spent somewhere in the region of 40-45 tries on Al&#8217;Akir, with people in different specs, talents, and tactics, coming to around 7 or 8 hours worth of practice.</p>
<p>After grilling and scrutinising every part of the encounter, we managed to get one magical attempt nailed and took him all the way down to zero, with myself bubbled to the very end.</p>
<p>We clearly need more work on this boss, but he&#8217;s another box ticked. Congratulations to everybody who took part &#8211; it was an &#8220;experience&#8221;!</p>
