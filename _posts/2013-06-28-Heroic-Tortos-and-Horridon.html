<p>Choosing the best point to &#8220;ignore everything and just nuke boss&#8221; is one of those veteran experiences that often get better through repetition. Sadly, on our first Tortos Heroic kill, we got it wrong and almost lost the kill to our overeager attitude at that time. Regardless, we killed it and got the progression in the bag, but having run out of time on Sunday we took the rest of the night to clear up and leave more progression for Wednesday.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#8217;s raid started off well (no Jin&#8217;rokh wipes!) so we had the opportunity to see Horridon through a few tries. After getting to gate 4 on the first attempt, we kept trying and found it fairly simple to get the kill.</p>
