<p>Twitter and Facebook are beginning to show signs of excitement for Blizzard&#8217;s 4th expansion to World of Warcraft, <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, and it&#8217;s time to stir up some excitement we&#8217;re all feeling within the guild too.</p>

<p>Last night Blizzard opened the <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/5891812/Unveil_the_mists_Join_now_the_Battle_of_Theramore-16_09_2012" target="_blank"><em>Theramore&#8217;s Fall</em> Scenario</a>, in which players experience the island destroyed through the conflict of the Alliance and Horde. This marks the beginning of the 7 day countdown, after which this scenario closes and will reactivate again at level 90.</p>

<p>What are your plans? Are you prepared digitally and physically?</p>
<p>Some level of discussion for us in the guild has been nutrition: how do we stay hydrated, fed, and alert for the long levelling stretch? How are you planning to combat the levels of stress and excitement?</p>
