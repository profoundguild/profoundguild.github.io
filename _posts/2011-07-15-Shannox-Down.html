<p>We killed Shannox on Monday, but I was messing around trying to take a stupid pose shot and I missed the corpse. We repeated the kill this week and took a pose shot so I could post the kill :smile: </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been popping shots at Rhylith on-and-off for a week, but I think we will take out Baleroc first. Fingers crossed!</p>
