<p>We were so close to killing <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=60400">Will of the Emperor</a> Heroic on Thursday that we scrambled ourselves into another night&#8217;s raid last night to finally net the kill on Heroic Will of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Everyone involved in this tier so far has something to be proud of with our latest kill. From the first Stone Guards, Saturday Feng and Gara&#8217;jal kills, then bashing our heads against the wall with Spirit Kings; it all worked out in the end. And the progress since we pulled ourselves back together has been very fun and amazingly quick work from everyone involved!</p>
