<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</span> <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/patchnotes=4.0.6" target="_blank">Wowhead 4.0.6 Patch Notes</a></p>
<p>After all the hotfixing and hype about class changes, finally all those changes we heard about on the PTR will be <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2166872" target="_blank"><strong>released to retail</strong></a> (updated!) this week (7th/9th February US/EU).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very good summary of changes <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2172-Patch-4.0.6-on-live-realms-this-week" target="_blank">over on MMO-Champion.com</a> with full retail patch notes styled and formatted for your reading pleasure.</p>
<p>Wowhead have also <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/blog=181914/patch-4-0-6-next-week" target="_blank">done the round-up</a> of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/patchnotes=4.0.6-ptr" target="_blank">PTR patch notes</a> which are as detailed as always (although I think MMO-Champion&#8217;s are more accurate at this time).</p>
<p>Some of the important changes we should all be aware of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall class changes</li>
<li><a title="Wow, Dungeons are Hard!" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469" target="_blank">Much anticipated</a> dungeon nerfs/buffs</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=63398" target="_blank">Armadillo Pup</a> is now available to revered guild members</li>
<li>Dungeon finder group difficulty <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2209011" target="_blank">now stacks at 5% per random member</a></li>
<li>Guild group XP can now be attained at 60% members for 50% XP, 80% for 100% XP and 100% for 150% XP (got that?)</li>
<li>Tol Barad is <a title="Tol Barad Balance" href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1683342#blog" target="_blank">now easier</a> to attack, with a 200% capture speed bonus when 2 keeps are controlled</li>
<li>All <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2170-Epic-Crafted-Items-Gem-Slots-Ink-Traders-in-4.0.6-Blue-Posts" target="_blank">crafted epics now get a new gem socket</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I would recommend reading all the changes made to your class. There are some very important ones, even ones that may rethink your role in raids. Also, <a href="{{ "/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=79" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">check out our own comments</a> on the patch notes in the forums.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
