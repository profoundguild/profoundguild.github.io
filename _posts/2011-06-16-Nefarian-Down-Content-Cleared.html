<p>What a trip this has been. So far we&#8217;ve had more drama than an Eastenders Christmas Special, and such a huge turnover of members that we should probably change our name.</p>
<p>The goal was to clear Cataclysm raid bosses before the next content patch &#8211; and we did it, with apparently only 1 more raid night to spare.</p>
<p>WELL DONE you bunch of awesome people, and thanks for being here through my stress and rants. You all deserve a cookie.</p>
