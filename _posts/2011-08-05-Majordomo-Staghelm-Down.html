<p>After an impressive raid week, getting 4 bosses on Wednesday cleared, then getting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52558">Lord Rhyolith</a> 2nd try last night (with three new people in the raid group), we started work on <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52571">Majordomo Staghelm</a> with an expectation to learn him then come back to kill him. However, it seems we underestimated ourselves and managed to learn him, practise, and kill him in a mere 9 tries. Granted, we had the help of <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/Blasto%C3%ACse/advanced">Blastoìse</a> (our secret weapon) but it does go to show we have the skills and drive to focus towards the same goal.</p>

<p>The corpse despawned since we took so long to decide on some loot, but here&#8217;s a shot of us on the stairs.</p>

<p>This kill also netted us a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=69897">Fandral&#8217;s Flamescythe</a> for <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/X%C3%A4vier/advanced">Xävier</a>, so congratulations to him! Now onto <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52409">Ragnaros</a>!</p>

<p>Also, on a side note, I crafted <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=19019"><span style="color: #ff8000 !important;">Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker</span></a> last night after scooping up the last of the materials I needed. So now we have 2 guild legendaries! Yay!</p>
