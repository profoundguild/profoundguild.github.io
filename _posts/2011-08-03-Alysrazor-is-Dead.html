<p>We killed <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52530">Alysrazor</a> on Monday, but I&#8217;m slack and hadn&#8217;t posted it yet. This boss was such a burden on us, even taking us through three phase groups to get it down (and this was amazingly done, by the way &#8211; grats to <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/totallytotem/simple">Totallytotem</a> an <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/phaan/simple">Phaan</a> for taking the slack when <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/X%C3%A4vier/simple">XÃ¤vier</a> snuffed it).</p>

<p>Well played by our new members on this evening. It took us way too long, but we finely tuned it in the end for the kill. Next time we will be much faster, well prepared and ready to slap this bird across the cheeks!</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s 5/7 and on to Majorhomo!</p>
