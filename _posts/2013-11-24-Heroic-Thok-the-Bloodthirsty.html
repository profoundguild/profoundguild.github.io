<p>We killed Thok the Bloodthirsty tonight on our 24th attempt. We thought it would be harder than Spoils of Orgrimmar, but itâ€™s definitely not. With enough planning and preparation, I expect it is a pushover for most guilds.</p>

<p>On this kill it felt like it was about time to strike a pose for a screenshot. Well done everybody!</p>
