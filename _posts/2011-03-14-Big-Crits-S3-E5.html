<p>I haven&#8217;t been posting many videos because I like to post only the ones I think make the biggest impact to me in the sense of how it relates to our own guild here.</p>
<p>This episode of Big Crits in particular is one of the most touching and relevant to us from the series so far. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
