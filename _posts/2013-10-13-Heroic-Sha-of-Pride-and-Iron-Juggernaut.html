<p>This week we focussed on getting down the bosses that appear to be easy, or we have a tactical advantage on. First up was Sha of Pride, being one of the bosses we skipped over last week due to some unknown ways we could deal with the mechanics. As it turns out, he&#8217;s just stupid easy and we had him down on our 5th pull.</p>

<p>The next guy on our list was the slightly harder Iron Juggernaut with his insane physical damage output. We wiped many times last week on him while we perfected a strategy, but this week we all individually came up with ways we could handle the clear problems we were facing and ended up falling into a pattern that meant we got the kill.</p>

<p>Our Sunday progress is somewhat tricky since we know General Nazgrim is pretty easy, but there&#8217;s a chance we may be able to get Dark Shaman down too &#8211; always nice to surprise ourselves!</p>
