<p>Wow, this was an incredibly easy fight. We spent one late night clearing up to these two and learned some tactics, then returned last night for less than 10 wipes for the kill.</p>
<p>But, we were so intent on killing something else we rushed off and forgot a screenshot. Typical, huh?</p>
<p>When Wowprogress finally updates, we should be able to show it on there, but until then, you will just have to do with this screenshot of the achievement:</p>
<div id="attachment_123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><span class="frame-outer  small size-medium wp-image-123"><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ValionaTheralionAchievement.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-123 " title="Valiona &amp; Theralion Guild Achievement" src="http://www.profoundguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ValionaTheralionAchievement-300x57.png" alt="Valiona &amp; Theralion Guild Achievement" width="300" height="57" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Substitute for Kill shot ;-)</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<p>Next time we&#8217;re here we promise to take a screen shot!</p>
<p>EDIT: Pose shot!</p>
