<p>We pooled every last bit of effort tonight to push the hardest we can at getting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=60143">Gara&#8217;jal the Spiritbinder</a> down; he&#8217;s a real challenge and seems to have a lot of RNG based problems. We gave ourselves a 20 second lead by swapping to the higher enchants, which I recommend every guild do to save yourselves some time! It was a very long process but we have it done, and we can now settle back down into learning the next fight.</p>
<p>This boss shall henceforth be known as &#8220;The Twat&#8221;.</p>
