<p>Although we forgot to take a screenshot last night when we defeated Conclave of Wind, it was nether-the-less a well deserved milestone of encounter experience for us.</p>
<p>Being a very technical fight, we took our time to try different combinations of healers, tanks and DPS at the platforms, eventually finding a combination that just-about worked for us, taking down Nazir last for an agility belt and holy paladin belt. Neither of which we needed for our main specs, but that&#8217;s just the luck of the draw.</p>
<p>Raid logs for the night (as always) are available here: <a href="http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-jclhlpbk5k52eo6h/dashboard/?s=1500&amp;e=1822" target="_blank">WorldOfLogs.com</a></p>
<p>Atramedes is next in our sights, and looks to be like a well designed fight!</p>
