<p><em>Now this is a story all about how</em><br />
<em>Zon&#8217;ozz took us time to get knocked down</em><br />
<em>If you&#8217;d like to take a minute and just sit right there</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ll tell you how we wasted time wiping in his lair</em></p>
<p><em>In West Dragonblight, flown by drake</em><br />
<em>In the Dragon Soul is where I spent most of my days</em><br />
<em>Healing up, damaging, tanking all cool</em><br />
<em>Shooting some Void ball outside of the pool</em><br />
<em>When a couple of Eyes, they were up to no good</em><br />
<em>Started beaming the raid in my assigned north group</em><br />
<em>I got hit by one little flail and my R.L. got scared</em><br />
<em>He said &#8220;you&#8217;re moving with the tank and the healer on the claw&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I listened to the man and when it came clear the</em><br />
<em>Fight seemed best with me at the rear</em><br />
<em>If anything I could say that my DPS was rare</em><br />
<em>But I thought &#8220;nah forget it, yo homes, just stand there!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I ran from the boss around bounce 7 or 8</em><br />
<em>And I yelled to the raid &#8220;Yo, homes, that was great!&#8221;</em><br />
<em>I watched the boss fall, we were finally there</em><br />
<em>To loot all our spoils from Zon&#8217;ozz&#8217;s lair </em></p>

<p>I might have spent too much time on that. Also, incoming parody, if I can find the acapella of that song.</p>

<p>Forgot a pose shot. But you got a parody rap. GET OFF MY CASE.</p>
