<p>This guy had a special place in our hearts for a long time, since he was the second heroic boss we tried with the advice that he was easier than the others.</p>
<p>Looking back at the kill, I can most definitely say that for a 10 man group, this guy is not as easy as you think. This is where the 10% rather than 4% raid responsibility comes in to play. We had many leaps on to orb-soakers which was unrecoverable, or leaps creating barriers between people and the boss, screwing up gathering for scorpion phases. A whole world of pain lied between us and the kill, until on Monday we finally got him with two orb phases.</p>

<p>We only have 2 more heroic modes to get now, with Baleroc almost in the bag already. We&#8217;ll be crossing our fingers, toes and nose hair for tonight&#8217;s attempts.</p>
