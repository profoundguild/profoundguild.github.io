<p>We finally got a stroke of luck on pulls last night on <em>Reset Kings</em> giving us 6 full tries out of 9 pulls, allowing us to take Subetai 2nd, Zian 3rd and Meng last to net the kill right on the berserk. We definitely need to improve on some things, but if we manage to get a kill video up you&#8217;ll see how easily it can get messy.</p>
<p>Imagine <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=117910">Flanking Orders</a> leading into a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=118047">Pillage</a> which is instantaneously followed by a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=117708">Maddening Shout</a>. <em>We had that</em>.</p>

<p>The future looks messy with our current progress giving us more options than the time we have for them, but we&#8217;ll make a plan and hopefully the next kill is very soon. Well done to everybody who contributed on this fight &#8211; easily the most fun so far in Mogu&#8217;shan Vaults!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Edit: It seems it was Flanking Orders, then Maddening Shout, then Pillaged. Ouch!</p>
